### To-do list:
* Distinguish ability flat values from percent bonuses more clearly; split them into categories somehow. Bonus calculation right now mixes adds values together indifferently to flat vs. percent. For example: Nemesis talent bonus calculations for Lift, Warp, etc.
* Refactor for consistent order of operations across all summaries.
